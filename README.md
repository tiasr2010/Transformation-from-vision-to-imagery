# Transformation-from-vision-to-imagery

This repository contains code demonstrating how voxel-to-voxel reduced-rank multivariate regression models were trained to isolate stimulus-specific activity from noisy multi-voxel patterns and to infer visual and imagery subspaces.

## Supported Operating Systems

- Ubuntu
- Windows 
- macOS

## Software Dependencies

The exact minimal requirements are not fully determined. However, the implementation relies primarily on standard Python libraries with very few external dependencies, so older versions of these packages may still work adequately.
